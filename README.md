## Usage
As seen on the demo, user is welcomed with the home page and a "Get Started" button. Once clicked, user is redirected to the notes taker / saver page. Inside the Title and Body text-fields, user types in their note and a save button appears in order to save the note. The saved note is then listed on the left hand side. Saved notes can be accessed simply by clicking on them and also delete by pressing the trash bin button.
